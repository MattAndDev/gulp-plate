## Layout

To create the structure of your page Gulp Plate provides you with some predefined helper classes. To better recognize them all layout classes are prefixed with `.l-`.

### Sections

You can divide pages in different sections. To create a section use the following markup:

```html
<section class="l-section">
	...
</section>
```

### Containers

To center the content inside a section use a `.l-container` class.

```html
<section class="l-section">
	<div class="l-container">
		...
	</div>
</section>
```

### Grid
The grid system has 24 columns with 30px gutters by default. All grid classes are prefixed with a `.g-` class.
