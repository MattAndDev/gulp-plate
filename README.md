**N.B.** We are working on a in-depth Gulp Plate Documentation. You can look at the [preview](http://arillo.github.io/gulp-plate-docs/) or follow the basic introcution here below. Watch this repository to get notified when the docs will be ready. Enjoy your meal!

**This is the ES2015 version of gulp-plate**

![Gulp Plate](http://turbo.aminalhazwani.com.s3.amazonaws.com/github/gulp-plate.png)

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) boilerplate & build system.

Includes the following tools, tasks, and workflows:

- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) (with [browserify-shim](https://github.com/thlorenz/browserify-shim))
- [Watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify) (caching version of browserify for super fast rebuilds)
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (super fast libsass with [source maps](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-ruby-sass#sourcemap), and [autoprefixer](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-autoprefixer))
- [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) (with source maps!)
- [BrowserSync](http://browsersync.io) for live reloading and a static server
- [Image optimization](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-imagemin)
- [Javascript linting](http://eslint.org/)
- [ES2015 transpilation](https://babeljs.io/)
- Error handling in the console [and in Notification Center](https://github.com/mikaelbr/gulp-notify)
- Shimming non common-js vendor code with other dependencies (like a jQuery plugin)
- Svg icon sprite generation using [gulp-svg-sprite](https://github.com/jkphl/gulp-svg-sprite)

## Dependencies / Installation

Install Node. If you use homebrew, do:

```bash
$ brew install node
```

Otherwise, you can download and install from [here](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Install Gulp globally:

```
$ npm install -g gulp
```

After the setup:

```
$ cd to project
$ npm install
```

This runs through all dependencies listed in `package.json` and downloads them to a `node_modules` folder in your project directory.

## `gulp` commands

```
$ gulp
```

Will generate a dev version of the theme in the `dist` folder


```
$ gulp watch
```

Will run the default task once, start a server and watch for file changes.

```
$ gulp production
```

Will generate a production version of the theme by running the tests and compressing js & css. This is the folder that should go on the server.

__Important:__

Every time you run one of the commands the generated theme will be deleted! Don't make any changes in that directory.

## Configuration

All paths and plugin settings have been abstracted into a centralized config object in `gulp/config.js`. Adapt the paths and settings to the structure and needs of your project.

## Folder structure

```bash
myTheme_source/
  gulp/         # all gulp tasks
  src/          # all source files
    icons/      # svg to be combined as a sprite
    images/     # other images
    js/         # js code, can be coffeescript or plain js (mix is possible)
    sass/       # Sass code, scss and sass syntax possible
    templates/  # Silverstripe templates
```

Any additional folder to be moved to the production theme needs a new dedicated task e.g. `"moveFonts"` if you would need to move a `fonts/` folder.

__Sprite config__

Set what type of sprite generation you want to use:

```javascript
...
svgSprite: {
  type: 'background' // set to 'inline' or 'background' (default)
  ...
}
...

```

- __`'background'`__ creates a svg sprite that can be used as a background image in css.
- __`'inline'`__ creates a svg image that can be used to reference icons with a `<use>` tag.

## Include external vendor css files

If you want to include external css files from npm or bower (bower is not setup by default but feel free to include it) you can just import them in your sass files as css imports. The gulp `sass` task will take care of pulling the file content into the generated css file.

```sass
// main.sass

@import "my-sass-module"
// will be inlined in the main file:
@import "../../node_modules/normalize.css/normalize.css"
```


__Note:__

This does not work if the `@import` is scoped inside a class like this:

```sass
// This will output a regular import!!!
.myClass
  @import "../../node_modules/normalize.css/normalize.css"
```

## Shim a jQuery plugin to work with browserify

```js
// package.json

{
...
  "browser": {
    // Path to your plugin
    "plugin": "./src/js/vendor/jquery-plugin.js"
  },
  "browserify-shim": {
    // Shim it and declare dependencies
    "plugin": {
      "exports": "plugin",
      "depends": [
        "jquery:$"
      ]
    }
  },
...
}

// use in main.js
import plugin from ('plugin');

plugin();

```

## Declare aliases for frequently required files

If you have to require one of your own files a lot you can add it as an alias to `"browser"` in the `package.json` file

```js
// package.json

{
...
  "browser": {
    // Path to your plugin
    "myScript": "./src/js/ui/my-script.js"
  },
...
}

// use in main.js
import myScript from 'myScript';
// instead of
import myScript from './ui/myScript';

```

## Known issues

- Sass sourcemaps are not working properly, the handling of Sass indented syntax seems a little buggy.
- No great sass & scss linter is available at the time of writing. https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint looks promising but does not seem finished yet.
- `.coffeeelintignore` seems not to be working, be aware when changing the path to watch more than your `./src/js` directory.
- The Sass files to be rendered as `.css` files need to have the extension `.sass` otherwise the compiler fails. Partials can be both `.sass` and `.scss`.
